# Welcome to Ingsoc-JS!

This is a project that utilizes the power of Node.js and NPM to create a small and lightweight Reactive library (themed after the novel 1984 by George Orwell, because why not). 


## Installation

Feel free to use Ingsoc-JS in your own projects if you want to. It's not even close to production ready (and probably never will be), but for curiosity's sake it may be fun to mess with and see what you can do with it. Just add this line:

```
"ingsoc-js": "git+https://github.com/dakatk/reactive-engine.git"
```

to the `dependencies` section of your project's `package.json`. After running `npm install`, all necessary files and dependencies should be installed into your project's `node_modules` folder.


## Documentation

Documentation is sparse at the moment, because this is mostly just a passion project I work on in my freetime. All planned features/fixes/enhancements can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/dakatk/reactive-engine/issues) tab.

A sample application built only using Ingsoc-JS can be found in the [example-app](https://github.com/dakatk/reactive-engine/tree/example-app) branch.


## Disclaimer

_I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ISSUES THAT MAY BE CAUSED BY INCLUDING INGSOC-JS IN A NEW OR EXISTING PROJECT. AS ALREADY STATED, THIS IS NOT A COMPLETED PRODUCT NOR SHOULD IT BE TREATED AS SUCH. IT IS NOT DEPLOYED AS A PACKAGE TO NPM BECAUSE THERE ARE PROBABLY A LOT OF BUGS AND ISSUES THAT I HAVEN'T FOUND YET. FRANKLY, THIS PROJECT WAS ONLY ORIGINALLY MEANT AS A CHALLENGE TO MYSELF TO SEE IF I COULD MAKE EVEN A PARTIALLY WORKING REACTIVE LOGIC/BUILD SYSTEM AND THE FACT THAT IT'S GONE THIS FAR IS A BIT OF A MIRACLE_
