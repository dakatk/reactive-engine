# Welcome to Ingsoc-JS!

This is a project that utilizes the power of Node.js and NPM to create a small and lightweight Reactive library (themed after the novel 1984 by George Orwell, because why not). 

The actualy library/cli tool can be found under the 'ingsoc-js' folder, and an example application can be found under the 'example-app' folder. 

**Build commands:**
```
cd example-app
npm run build
```

**Serve commands:**
```
cd example-app
npm run start
```

Documentation is sparse at the moment, because this is mostly just a passion project I work on in my freetime. All planned features/fixes/enhancements can be found in the [issues](https://github.com/dakatk/reactive-engine/issues) tab.
